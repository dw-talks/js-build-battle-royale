# JavaScript Build System Battle Royale!!!!
Five JavaScript build systems enter. Only one leaves. You decide the victor in this battle royale between the five different JavaScript build systems: Broccoli, Grunt, Gulp, WebPack, and Vanilla Node Script. In this 60 minute battle to the bare bits, we will pin these five build systems up against each other by reviewing them one by one by having them do what they do best: build JavaScript projects. Weâ€™ll take one project and build it each with the build systems to decide who can be crowded the JavaScript Build System champion!

## Build Commands
`npm run build:<broccoli|grunt|gulp|node|webpack>`

e.g. `npm run build:gulp`

## Serve Commands
`npm run serve:<broccoli|grunt|gulp|node|webpack>`

e.g. `npm run serve:gulp`
